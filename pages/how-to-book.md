### You can either: 

[**Book Here**](#booking-form){:.booking-trigger .button .small} to use the **simple online booking system on this page**, OR 

[**Contact me**](#contact-trigger){:.contact-trigger .button .small} using any of the methods at the bottom of the page.

**If you can't make any of the clinic slots I have available, please get in contact, when it is really difficult for people to attend treatment I am sometimes able to get additional clinic space.**

### Not sure what kind of consultation you need?...

* If you **aren't sure whether Acupuncture is the right choice for you** then the quickest thing is just to [contact me](#contact-trigger){:.contact-trigger} using any of the methods at the bottom of the page and we can have a chat. OR, book the 'Exploratory Consultation'

* If you **know you want Acupuncture treatment but haven't yet had any treatment with me** then book the 'Full Initial Consultation'

* If you have **already had treatment with me** and are booking another session then book the 'Follow-up Treatment'

#### REMEMBER TO CHOOSE THE APPOINTMENT TYPE FOR THE CLINIC YOU PREFER.
