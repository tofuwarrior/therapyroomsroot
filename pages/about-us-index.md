  	We established Cardiff Wellbeing Clinic to be a clinic where you are valued and supported so you can be at your best for your clients, feeling secure and fulfilled in your practise.

As experienced committed therapists we have worked in different clinics and we both recognise how different it feels to be part of a clinic community where you are valued and supported as opposed to being just a source of rental income. We decided we wanted to run a values based clinic that provides security and community and in which contribution is recognised with gratitude and appreciation.
