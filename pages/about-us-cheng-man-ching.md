The quick answer is that, having experienced for myself some of the great benefits Acupuncture can bring, I wanted to study it so I could help people get the most out of what life has to offer in the same way as my Acupuncturist had for me.

**The longer answer is a short story of learning...**

Prior to training as an Acupuncturist I had been practising and teaching, the Chinese, meditative martial art  Tai Chi for about 7 years, this provided lots of benefits for my health and general well-being as well as helping me to make some very positive changes in my life.  I wanted to share these benefits with others and so engaged in teacher training.  This training led to my looking to develop a greater depth of knowledge of the body’s physical and energetic systems which in turn led to my trying out Acupuncture as a patient.

I tried it mainly out of curiosity to see if it would do anything for me and even after the first treatment I could feel that it had helped me at a deep level, I felt grounded and calm and at peace just as I did when practising Tai chi, these benefits continued.  I also found that over time as I had treatment, as well as health benefits and a greater feeling of contentment and relaxation,  it made it easier to deal with challenging life situations.  I continued to have regular treatment and the benefits built up;  I slept better,  had more energy, it rapidly resolved a stubborn muscle injury that was not improving, it increased my ability to respond well to life’s challenges. It really felt like magic!

Experiencing this as a patient was inspiring and so I decided to commit to the 4 year degree to actually become an Acupuncturist. I trained at one of Europe’s most respected college’s, the College for Integrated Chinese Medicine in Reading, so the course was demanding but the 4 years of hard study and clinical training was massively inspiring. 

The greatest joy is seeing Acupuncture set people free from the limitations restricting them, so they can live more of the life they wish to live, it is deeply satisfying to see.

> The longer I practise, the more Acupuncture amazes me with what it can do and so my passion for what it can do for both children and adults increases. It is a really remarkable form of medicine.
