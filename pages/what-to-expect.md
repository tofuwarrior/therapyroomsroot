Acupuncture is an amazing form of medicine, gentle and minimal but wide ranging and effective. It is inspiring what it can do for us when we are unwell and I am passionate about helping people so the first things you or the child you care will experience is that you will:
  * feel listened to
  * be taken seriously
  * feel comfortable
  * be cared for professionally and with commitment

> Your wellbeing, and what is important to you are always my top priorities.

### About The Initial Consultation
The initial consultation is where we discuss your situation so you can tell me everything that is important to you and so I can gather a comprehensive understanding of your health and wellbeing and what you want help with. This session also includes treatment.

In this comprehensive conversation we talk about all aspects of your health and wellbeing. By getting a comprehensive understanding of your situation that I am able to see patterns in your health that are causing your problems. Identifying these patterns is what guides me to an understanding of what the root of your problem is. By Correcting this root cause ** we resolve the cause of your issue and it is resolved**

You **remain either clothed or wearing a treatment gown** for both the initial consultation and treatment so your privacy is protected at all times.
Depending on what you need help with, and as long as you are happy for me to do so, I may ask to check for tenderness by gently pressing Acupuncture points in different places on your body such as your belly, your back or on your arms and legs, this is because feelings of tenderness in specific areas can give information about the nature a problem. If for personal, or cultural, reasons you do not wish to be treated in certain areas, just let me know; it is usually still possible to treat you effectively but also in a way that respects your individual needs.

**Your treatment and your comfort are always my first priorities so, nothing happens without your consent. **

### About Treatment

Treatment usually involves the gentle insertion of Acupuncture needles but can also involve other Chinese Medical treatment techniques. If I think a different treatment method will be helpful then I discuss this with you first to check you are happy about it, nothing happens in the treatment room without your explicit consent so if there is a reason you don't feel comfortable with a particular kind of treatment, then you can let me know and we can discuss alternative options.
You can [find descriptions of the treatment techniques I am trained in here](/about-acupuncture/acupuncture-treatment-methods.html)

Treatment happens with you sitting or lying on a comfortable treatment couch. The position you are in depends on what you are comfortable with and what Acupuncture points I need to use to treat you. There are Acupuncture points all over the body, all with different uses, but for any condition there are multiple points that could be used so if there is a reason why you can’t sit or lie in a particular position or you don’t wish to be treated on a particular part of your body then it is usually simple to make changes.  The treatment couch can be raised and lowered so if you have mobility problems this can help.

If your clothes are too tight or don't allow for me to treat you where you need treatment then I leave the room  so you can change into treatment gowns that ensure your privacy.

**Your treatment and your comfort are always my first priorities so at all times you are in control of whether you want a particular treatment, nothing happens without your consent. **
