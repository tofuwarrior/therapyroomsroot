 Tai Chi, Qi Gong and the other practises we teach all can help health and wellbeing in many ways and you cannot get the benefit of them simply by by reading books because they are practical skills. They do however have a fascinating history. Some students, also find reading about the practises a helpful addition to regular practise that enriches their experience of these arts.

  In this section you will find information that covers a range of areas. We will be expanding this section so if there is something you think is missing then please contact us to let us know.
