  Tai Chi Chuan and Qigong, (pronounced Chi Kung), is a traditional Chinese exercise which uses sequences of graceful gentle movement, developed by martial arts masters centuries ago, to promote wholeness and health.¨Through simple warm-ups, and the Short Form sequence, we explore the physical principles which include working with body alignment, gentle stretching, and folding/opening of joints; using these natural and nourishing exercises to help bring the body into balance.
  Through natural breathing and releasing of habitual tensions in the body and mind, Tai Chi helps us to connect with our own sense of well-being and vitality, we learn to meet all the challenges of day to day life with a focused intuitive awareness.¨Tai Chi is a gentle exercise and is suitable for all ages.¨ Beginners are welcome and improvers are invited to deepen their relationship with this ¨beautiful art of movement.
